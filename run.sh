#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Launches a fresh, disposable sandbox container scoped to the current directory - run
# this from whatever project you want the harness (Claude Code by default, or anything
# else in the image) to have access to. Only $PWD and the harness's own login/state get
# mounted in; nothing else on the host is reachable from inside, and the container is
# removed on exit (--rm) so there's no persistent state or mount to go stale. Extra
# arguments starting with `-` are forwarded to the harness itself (e.g. `run.sh
# --continue`); anything else overrides the harness's default command entirely (e.g.
# `run.sh bash` for a plain shell).
#
# `--harness <name>` (consumed here, not forwarded on) picks which harness to run, i.e.
# which harnesses/<name>/harness.conf decides the mounts and default command, and which
# devcontainer:<name> image to start (build it with `build.sh <name>`). Defaults to
# $HARNESS (environment or config/run.local.sh), else claude.
#
# Runs on Docker's default bridge network unless `--host-network` is passed (consumed
# here, not forwarded on). Only needed when the host's own network setup - e.g. a
# corporate VPN - blocks the bridge network from reaching DNS/the internet; see
# README.md. `--host-network` shares the host's network namespace outright, so treat it
# as an opt-in trade of isolation for connectivity, not a default. Run `run.sh --help`
# for a summary of flags and this machine's resolved config (mounts, network mode).
#
# `--allow-list <path>` (consumed here, not forwarded on) swaps the squid egress
# allowlist for that one session: the given file is bind-mounted read-only and
# entrypoint.sh overwrites the image's baked-in allowed-domains.txt with it before squid
# starts. Only affects this disposable container - the image itself, and every other
# session, still use the default list. See README.md.
#
# `--mount <path>` or `--mount <host:container[:ro]>` (consumed here, not forwarded on;
# repeatable) adds one extra bind mount to this session only, on top of $PWD/the
# harness's state/run.local.sh's EXTRA_MOUNTS. A bare path with no ':' mounts read-write at that
# same path on both sides (e.g. `--mount ~/data` -> ~/data:~/data); give host:container[:ro]
# explicitly to mount elsewhere or read-only. Use it for a one-off session that needs a
# path run.local.sh doesn't already cover; for anything needed on every session on this
# machine, put it in run.local.sh instead.
#
# `--allow-internet` (consumed here, not forwarded on) drops squid's domain allowlist for this
# one session: entrypoint.sh patches the running config so `http_access allow
# allowed_dst` becomes `http_access allow all`, while leaving the Safe_ports/SSL_ports
# checks in place (still only plain HTTP on 80 and CONNECT to 443 through the proxy).
# Traffic is still proxied and logged, just no longer domain-filtered. Only affects this
# disposable container - the image, allowed-domains.txt, and every other session are
# untouched. Mutually exclusive with --allow-list (one drops the list, the other swaps
# it - combining them is almost certainly not what you meant).
#
# `--allow-container` (consumed here, not forwarded on) bind-mounts the HOST's own Docker
# socket (/var/run/docker.sock) into the container, instead of the nested dockerd
# entrypoint.sh otherwise starts inside the container. Containers started this way are
# siblings on the host's real Docker daemon, not nested inside the sandbox - they see the
# host's other containers/images/networks and are not cleaned up when this container
# exits. Off by default: a container's root-equivalent access to the host's Docker socket
# is effectively root on the host (bind-mount any host path in, run as any UID). Only pass
# this for a workflow that specifically needs the host daemon (e.g. driving host
# `docker compose` services) and that you trust to run inside this sandbox.
#
# `--sysbox` (consumed here, not forwarded on) swaps `--privileged` for
# `--runtime=sysbox-runc` (https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox), which must already be
# installed and registered with the host's Docker daemon - this script only selects it,
# it doesn't install it. Sysbox gives the nested dockerd entrypoint.sh starts real
# user-namespace isolation instead of `--privileged`'s "may as well be root on the host"
# access, at the cost of a host-side dependency beyond plain Docker. Irrelevant if
# combined with --allow-container, since that path skips the nested dockerd entirely -
# there's nothing left for sysbox's isolation to apply to.
#
# `--allow-config` (consumed here, not forwarded on) lets this session write to the
# harness's *configuration*. By default it can't: the harness's `state` dirs (e.g.
# ~/.claude - transcripts, history, OAuth token refreshes; the harness breaks without
# them) stay read-write, but its `config` entries (plus EXTRA_CONFIG_RO_PATHS) are
# bind-mounted read-only on top of them, and its `staged` files (e.g. ~/.claude.json)
# are mounted read-only at a staging path that entrypoint.sh copies into the
# container's own $HOME (the harness rewrites those on every start, so they must stay
# writable - edits just never reach the host). The point: hooks, MCP servers, plugins,
# agents, commands and skills all run with full access on the HOST the next time you
# run the harness natively, so a session that gets talked into editing them could
# escape the sandbox. See harnesses/README.md.

              [-h|--help] [harness-args... | command...]

Launches a fresh, disposable sandbox container scoped to \$PWD. Only \$PWD and the
harness's login/state are mounted in; the container is removed on exit (--rm).

  -h, --help        Show this help (reflects this machine's actual config below) and exit.
  --harness NAME    Which harness to run (harnesses/NAME/, image devcontainer:NAME).
                    Defaults to \$HARNESS, else claude. Available: $(cd "$script_dir/harnesses" && ls -d */ | tr -d / | tr '\n' ' ')
  --host-network    Share the host's network namespace instead of Docker's default
                    bridge network. Only needed if the host's network (e.g. a
                    corporate VPN) blocks the bridge network from reaching the
                    internet. Consumed here, never forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --allow-list PATH Replace the squid egress allowlist for this session only, with
                    PATH (one domain per line, same format as allowed-domains.txt).
                    Doesn't touch the image or other sessions. Consumed here, never
                    forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --allow-internet  Drop squid's domain allowlist for this session only - any host is
                    reachable, still only over plain HTTP (80) or CONNECT to 443,
                    still proxied and logged. Mutually exclusive with --allow-list.
                    Consumed here, never forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --mount SPEC      Add one extra bind mount for this session only. A bare PATH mounts
                    read-write at that same path on both sides; use host:container[:ro]
                    to mount elsewhere or read-only. Repeatable. On top of run.local.sh's
                    EXTRA_MOUNTS, not a replacement for it. Consumed here, never
                    forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --allow-container Bind-mount the HOST's own Docker socket in, instead of the sandbox's
                    nested dockerd. Containers started this way run on the host daemon as
                    siblings, not nested inside the sandbox - host-visible, not cleaned up
                    when this container exits. OFF by default: this is root-equivalent
                    access to the host. Consumed here, never forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --allow-config    Let this session change the harness's config on the host (its
                    harness.conf \`config\` and \`staged\` entries, e.g. settings/hooks/
                    plugins under ~/.claude and ~/.claude.json). OFF by default: those
                    are read-only, and in-session edits to staged files are discarded on
                    exit. Session state (transcripts, history, login) stays writable
                    either way. Consumed
                    here, never forwarded to docker/the harness.
  --sysbox          Use the sysbox-runc OCI runtime instead of --privileged, for real
                    user-namespace isolation around the nested dockerd. Must already be
                    installed and registered with this host's Docker daemon - see
                    https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox. Consumed here, never forwarded
                    to docker/the harness.

Anything else starting with '-' is forwarded to the harness itself (e.g. --continue).
A bare command (e.g. \`run.sh bash\`) overrides the harness's default command
($(harness_conf command)) entirely. Full details: README.md.
